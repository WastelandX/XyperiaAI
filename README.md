# XyperiaAI

XyperiaAI is a local command-line intelligence designed to be uncensored and respond, not perform.

It does not explain itself.  
It does not negotiate tone.

You ask.  
It answers.

## Design Intent

XyperiaAI was built to eliminate three things common in modern assistants:

- verbosity
- self-reference
- performative safety

The system prioritizes precision over personality and output over conversation.

## Characteristics

- Terminal-native interface  
- Streaming responses with no post-processing  
- Automatic background engine initialization  
- Automatic model provisioning on first execution  
- Fully local execution after initialization  
- No accounts, no authentication, no network dependency after setup
